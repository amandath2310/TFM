Electron correlation analysis in non-adiabatic systems.

At the moment the tasks being performed are divided into the following parts: 
* H2 dissociation: in General_code the main results are condensed
* Ethylene dissociation

Each one contains the main codes to perform the calculations as well as the representation of the results. The final explanation of them is provided separately.
